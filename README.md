# Hip-Hop Peoples — Architecture & Governance

**Public transparency layer for the Hip-Hop Peoples ecosystem.**

Maintained by [Hip-Hop Peoples DAO LLC](https://hiphoppeoples.dao)

---

## What This Repo Is

This repository holds **public architecture documentation, governance summaries, and transparency materials** for the Hip-Hop Peoples ecosystem — including Hip-Hop Healing Institute (HHHI), Krafty Academy, GGHP, and related programs.

It exists so that participants, partners, funders, and auditors can understand **how the ecosystem is structured** and **what rules govern it** — without exposing private operational data.

## What's Here

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`docs/ecosystem-routing-map.md`](docs/ecosystem-routing-map.md) | How information flows across our 5-layer stack (GitLab → GitHub → website → DAO → chain) |
| [`docs/freedom-notes-overview.md`](docs/freedom-notes-overview.md) | What Freedom Notes™ are, what they are not, and how they work |

---

## What's NOT Here

This repo contains **patterns, not records**.

You will not find here:

- Participant data, case notes, or personal information
- Freedom Notes balances or individual allocations
- Incident reports, enforcement actions, or dispute details
- Internal policies, manuals, or operational controls

That information lives in private systems (GitLab) with appropriate access controls.
