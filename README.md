# Hip-Hop Peoples — Architecture & Governance

**Public transparency layer for the Hip-Hop Peoples ecosystem.**

Maintained by [Hip-Hop Peoples DAO LLC](https://hiphoppeoples.dao)

## What This Repo Is

This repository holds **public architecture documentation, governance summaries, and transparency materials** for the Hip-Hop Peoples ecosystem — including Hip-Hop Healing Institute (HHHI), Krafty Academy, GGHP, and related programs.

It exists so that participants, partners, funders, and auditors can understand **how the ecosystem is structured** and **what rules govern it** — without exposing private operational data.
