## What Are Freedom Notes™?

Freedom Notes™ are **non-monetary participation and governance credits** used within the Hip-Hop Peoples ecosystem.

They exist to:

- Recognize **community participation and contribution**
- Support **shared governance and decision-making**
- Encourage engagement across programs (healing, education, creative work)

Freedom Notes™ are **not money**, **not investments**, and **not transferable assets**.

---

## What Freedom Notes™ Are NOT

Freedom Notes™:

- ❌ Are **not currency**
- ❌ Are **not securities or investments**
- ❌ Are **not redeemable for cash**
- ❌ Are **not transferable or tradable**
- ❌ Do **not** represent ownership, profit rights, or financial claims

They do **not** appear on nonprofit financial statements and are kept separate from donations, grants, wages, or stipends.

## What Freedom Notes™ Are Used For

Within the Hip-Hop Peoples ecosystem, Freedom Notes™ may be used to:

- Document volunteer service and participation
- Determine eligibility for certain programs or opportunities
- Weight governance participation in DAO-based decision processes
- Acknowledge contributions to shared community work

They are **internal recognition units**, not a payment system.

---

## Governance & Oversight

Freedom Notes™ are administered by **Hip-Hop Peoples DAO LLC**, a governance and participation-tracking entity.

Key safeguards:

- Clear separation between DAO governance and nonprofit finances
- No commingling with bank accounts or grant funds
- No use as employee or contractor compensation
- Transparent policies and documented controls

Governance decisions that affect the ecosystem are published publicly, while individual participation records remain private.

---

## Relationship to Gift Cards & Programs

Some programs within the ecosystem may offer **gift cards or prepaid service certificates** issued by operating entities.

Important distinction:

- Gift cards are **financial instruments** governed by consumer laws
- Freedom Notes™ are **non-financial recognition credits**

Redeeming a gift card for services **may** result in Freedom Notes™ being credited to acknowledge participation — but there is **no fixed exchange rate** and no conversion back to cash or value.

---

## Privacy & Data Protection

- Freedom Notes™ ledgers use **internal identifiers**, not public names
- No personal, medical, or legal case data is stored publicly
- Public systems share **structure and rules**, not individual records

---

## Why This Model Exists

The Hip-Hop Peoples ecosystem works in real-world conditions:

- Community healing
- Workforce development
- Creative economies
- Justice-impacted support

Freedom Notes™ allow participation and governance to be recognized **without creating financial risk**, regulatory exposure, or exploitation.
